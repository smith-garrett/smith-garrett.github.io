### About me
I am a postdoc in [Shravan Vasisth's](https://vasishth.github.io/) lab at the University of
Potsdam working on building and testing models of sentence comprehension. As a part of the
[Collaborative Research Center 1287](https://www.sfb1287.uni-potsdam.de/), I work on
integrating such models with a computational model of eye-movement control during reading. I
got my Ph.D. from the Psychology department at the University of Connecticut. Before that, I
completed my Master's degree in Linguistics at the Institute for German Language and
Linguistics at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.

### Open data and code
I put all of my model code on my [Github page](https://github.com/smith-garrett), and
preprints, data, and analysis code are on my [OSF page](https://osf.io/bn2cs/).
