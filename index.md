### About me

Before leaving academia, I was a postdoc in [Shravan Vasishth's](https:// vasishth.github.io/) lab at the University of Potsdam working on building and testing stochastic models of sentence comprehension. As a part of the [Collaborative Research Center 1287](https://www.sfb1287.uni-potsdam.de/), I worked on integrating such models with a computational model of eye-movement control during reading. I got my Ph.D. from the Psychology department at the University of Connecticut. Before that, I completed my Master's degree in Linguistics at the Institute for German Language and Linguistics at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
